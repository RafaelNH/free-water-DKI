    "Simulates are performed using multi-compartmental models which describe tissue within each image voxel as a sum of $N$ impermeable compartments.

    "In this study, to simultaneously simulate tissue's diffusion heterogeneity and free water contamination, three compartments are used for the simulations. The first compartment is used to model the free water comtamination with a isotropic diffusion of $3\\times10^{-3}mm^{2}.s^{-1}$. To model different degrees of water volume, simulations are repeated for different values of the free water volume fraction $f_w$. The other two compartments are used to model the tissue's diffusion. In a biological prespective, these compartments can be interpreted as the intra and extra-cellular components of tissue's diffusion, however for the sake of generality, in this study, these will be refered as the slow and fast tissue compartment. Similar to previous studies (Neto Henriques et al., 2015), the axial and radial diffusivities for slow compartment are set to $0.99\\times10^{-3}$ and $0.0\\times10^{-3} mm^{2}.s^{-1}$, while the axial and radial diffusivities for the fast compartment are set to $2.26\\times10^{-3}$ and $0.87\\times10^{-3}mm^{2}.s^{-1}$. To generate different degrees of tissue anisotropy and heterogeneity, simulations are repeated for different pairs of slow and fast diffusion volume fractions $f_s$ and $f_f$. Each pair was characterized by the fraction between the slow diffusion campartment relative to the total tissue's fraction: \n",
